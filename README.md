> A full-stack data project for analyzing cyber attacks on individuals and companies, combining multiple datasets in a MySQL data warehouse, cleaning and analysis in Python, visualization in Power BI, and using a Random Forest algorithm to predict anomaly score classes.
>
> Cyber Avalanche aims to streamline the process of cyber attack analysis by providing a comprehensive data pipeline from ingestion to visualization and machine learning. The goal is to identify and predict potential anomalies in cyber attack patterns to better understand vulnerabilities and enhance security


### User Stories
- As a user, I want to view visualizations of cyber attack data in Power BI dashboards, so I can quickly gain insights into where and how attacks are happening.

- As a business executive, I want to assess the impact of cyber attacks through detailed reports, so I can make informed decisions about security investments and risk management.

- As a data engineer, I want to ensure the data is processed and updated efficiently from multiple sources, so I can keep the system reliable for continuous analysis.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

### Cyber Avalanche is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as the primary data warehouse for storing and managing multiple datasets on cyber attacks targeting individuals and companies.

- For data cleaning and preprocessing, [Python](https://www.python.org/) is used along with libraries like Pandas and NumPy, which provide powerful tools for transforming, filtering, and analyzing the data.

- To create visualizations that help identify trends and anomalies in cyber attacks, [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) is utilized for interactive dashboards and reports.

- For machine learning and anomaly detection, a [Random Forest algorithm](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) from Scikit-learn is used to predict anomaly score classes, helping organizations mitigate cyber threats.

- The project adheres to best practices in data engineering, ensuring smooth data ingestion, transformation, and presentation across all stages of the pipeline.
